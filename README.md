### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ My academic pursuit in Computer Vision and Deep Learning initially centered around video understanding,
with a focus on action recognition and detection. Later, I explored the realm of Self-supervised Learning,
studying how machines can learn autonomously from inherent data structures. Recently, my interest has gravitated
towards the intersection of 3D/4D World Reconstruction and Understanding. My primary research
now seeks to reconstruct/generate structured/semantic 3D/4D world for intelligent interactions, bridging 3D/4D
construction with semantic comprehension. The ultimate aim is to harness these models to facilitate seamless
communication between machines, humans, and their environments.
